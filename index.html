    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Abdelhakim and this is my first web design project.
  I am learning how to create web pages using HTML and CSS,
  and I am starting with a simple page that has text, an image,
  and a list to show what I can do.</p>
    <p> Building this page helps me understand how websites are
  organized. I am not entirely sure what I am doing but I am watching a lot of tutorials that is making the process 
  easier. I hope to know how to do everything professionally soon..</p>
    <p>In the future I hope to make larger and more creative sites.
  Learning how to code and design feels rewarding because I can
  see what I build appear on the screen, and that keeps me
  motivated to keep improving.</p>
